					I fell in love with poker through playing with friends, and since then, I've never looked back. Poker is an incredibly interesting game where you have to make a lot of decisions on the fly that mean something. It is competitive, cerebral, and exciting. I have spent a lot of time refining my game, and with this, comes a time committment to succeed. I hope to one day become a professional poker player.

					I started watching sports when I was a little kid, and remember just being in love with it since then. Sports represent the excitment of being able to compete at the highest level, and they bring people together amidst hate. I watch mostly basketball and football, but really enjoy watching anything and everything that's competitive and exciting. I always wanted to be a basketball player growing up, but now I can safely sit on my couch and enjoy the competition.

					I started traveling with my parents, and have since vistied over 30 states, and 3 continents. Because traveling allows you to get a unique perspective that you don't get every day, it's somethign that I really enjoy taking part of and being involved with. I hope to be able to travel the world when I am older and want to visit Antarctica soon.
